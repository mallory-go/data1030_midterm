This analysis aimed to predict fight wins – with a particular focus on title fight wins – using machine learning algorithms. I predict that all models will not have accurate performance (AUROC > 0.7) due to the volatility of the sport and – historically – unobserved or unrecorded factors such as injuries, psychological issues, or even pure luck (as seen by “upsets” or unexpected outcomes) can impact or determine the winner of a fight. The Red corner is generally considered the “favorite” fighter, the fighter predicted to win the fight, and the Blue corner is assigned to the other fighter. The UFC organization has not disclosed how fighter odds or the ‘favorite’ fighter is determined.
