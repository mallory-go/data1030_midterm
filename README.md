All (raw and preprocessed) data files are in /data, all your generated figures are in /figures, your results (predictions, saved models, etc) should be in /results, the pdf version of your final report should be in /report, and all of your source codes (ipython notebooks or python files) should be in /src. If your dataset is too big to store on github, it’s OK if you do not have a data folder but include a link to the dataset in the readme file.
